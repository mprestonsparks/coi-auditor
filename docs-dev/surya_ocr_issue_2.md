# Surya OCR Integration Issue (Round 2)

## Description

The `coi-auditor` project aims to extract data from Certificates of Insurance (COIs). We are using the `surya-layout` library for layout detection and `pytesseract` and `easyocr` for OCR. We have successfully integrated `surya-layout` to detect layout regions. We are now trying to extract dates from the images, but the OCR results are not accurate or reliable enough to extract the dates correctly.

We have implemented image preprocessing techniques, including grayscale conversion, resizing, noise reduction, and binarization. We have also tried different OCR configurations and post-processing techniques. However, none of these approaches have been successful in extracting dates from the `debug_page_image.png` file.

We have tried using both `pytesseract` and `easyocr` for OCR, but neither engine is able to extract meaningful text from the cropped and preprocessed images.

## Specific Questions

1.  Given that both `pytesseract` and `easyocr` are failing to extract meaningful text from the cropped and preprocessed images, what are the potential reasons for this failure?
2.  Are there any specific image characteristics that make OCR particularly difficult (e.g., low resolution, poor contrast, complex background)?
3.  What are the most effective image preprocessing techniques for improving OCR accuracy in challenging cases?
4.  Are there any advanced OCR techniques that can be used to improve the accuracy of date extraction (e.g., using language models or context-aware OCR)?
5.  Are there any publicly available datasets of COI images that can be used to train a custom OCR model?

## Additional Information

*   We are using `surya-layout` for layout detection.
*   We are using `pytesseract` and `easyocr` for OCR.
*   We have implemented image preprocessing techniques, including grayscale conversion, resizing, noise reduction, and binarization.
*   We have implemented post-processing techniques, including character correction and regular expression matching.
*   We are using Python 3.11.
*   The `debug_page_image.png` file is located in the root directory of the project.
*   The project base directory is: `c:/Users/Butle/Desktop/Preston/gitRepos/coi-auditor`

## Design Decisions

*   We chose to use `pytesseract` and `easyocr` for OCR because they are readily available and easy-to-use libraries.
*   We are using a rule-based approach for date extraction and verification.
