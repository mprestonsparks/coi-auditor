# Surya OCR Integration Issue

## Description

The `coi-auditor` project aims to extract data from Certificates of Insurance (COIs). We are using the `surya-layout` library for layout detection and `pytesseract` for OCR. We have successfully integrated `surya-layout` to detect layout regions, and we are using `pytesseract` to extract text from those regions. However, we are encountering issues with extracting dates from the images.

The `surya_test.py` script performs layout detection, extracts text from the detected layout regions using `pytesseract`, and uses `fuzzywuzzy` to identify potential headers based on their text content. The goal is to extract key data fields, especially policy dates, based on the location of identified headers.

We have identified potential header regions (e.g., "CERTIFICATE OF LIABILITY INSURANCE", "COVERAGES", "IMPORTANT") using fuzzy matching. However, when we try to extract the dates from the image, the OCR results are not accurate or reliable enough to extract the dates correctly.

We suspect that the issue might be with the image itself or the OCR process. The current image being used is `debug_page_image.png`.

## Specific Questions

1.  What are the best practices for pre-processing images before performing OCR with `pytesseract` to improve the accuracy of date extraction?
2.  Are there any specific `pytesseract` configurations or settings that are recommended for extracting dates from images?
3.  Are there any alternative OCR libraries or APIs that might provide better accuracy for date extraction compared to `pytesseract`?
4.  What are the common causes of inaccurate OCR results, and how can we mitigate these issues?
5.  Are there any techniques for post-processing the OCR output to improve the accuracy of date extraction (e.g., using regular expressions or date parsing libraries)?

## Additional Information

*   We are using `surya-layout` for layout detection and `pytesseract` for OCR.
*   We have successfully integrated layout detection and text extraction.
*   We are using `fuzzywuzzy` for fuzzy matching of headers.
*   We are using Python 3.11.
*   The `debug_page_image.png` file is located in the root directory of the project.
*   The project base directory is: `c:/Users/Butle/Desktop/Preston/gitRepos/coi-auditor`

## Design Decisions

*   We chose to use `pytesseract` for OCR because it is a readily available and easy-to-use library.
*   We chose to use `fuzzywuzzy` for fuzzy matching because it provides a simple and effective way to identify potential headers.
